/*
* Because the adjacency relation between cities is symmetric, 
* this two-dimensional array is a symmetric matrix. 
* And since each city belongs to its own city-circle, 
* all of the diagonal entries are 1. 
* In this problem, each row represents a node 
* and each column indicates whether there is an adjacent node. 
* Therefore, there are exactly n nodes in total; 
* each node can have at most n edges 
* (meaning itâ€™s adjacent to every city) 
* and at least one edge 
* (meaning its city-circle contains only itself).
